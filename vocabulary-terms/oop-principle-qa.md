## Questions & Answer


### Questions

__1.__ What is OOPS?

__2.__ What is the 5 objects oriented design principle from SOLID?

__3.__ Is Java a pure object oriented language? if not why?



### Answers

__1.__ OOPS is abbreviated as Object Oriented Programming system in which programs are considered as a collection of objects. Each object is nothing but an instance of a class.

__2.__ SOLID is the term given by Uncle Bob in his classic book, the Clean Code, one of the must-read books for programmers. In SOLID each character stands for one design principle:
> S for Single Responsibility Principle
> O for Open closed design principle
> L for Liskov substitution principle
> I for Interface segregation principle
> D for Dependency inversion principle

__3.__ Java is not a pure object-oriented programming language e.g. there are many things you can do without objects e.g. static methods. Also, primitive variables are not objects in Java. See the answer for a more detailed explanation.
