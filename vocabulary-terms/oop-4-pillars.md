# Oject Oriented Programming Four Pillars

> APIE : Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation


## Abstraction

Selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details to the object. It helps to reduce programming complexity and effort. In Java, abstraction is accomplished using Abstract classes and interfaces. 


## Polymorphism

Refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.


## Inheritance 

Is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.

__Important terminology:__

* Super Class: The class whose features are inherited is known as super class(or a base class or a parent class).
* Sub Class: The class that inherits the other class is known as sub class(or aderived class, extended class, or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.


## Encapsulation

When the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared. Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.
