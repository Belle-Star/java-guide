# Fundamental Programming Structures

## Data Type

In Java, every variable has a type.

Variables are declared by first stating the type of the variable, followed by the name of the variable.

Each declaration is considered a statement

Each statement is followed by a semi-colon `;`

```
double salary;
int vacationDays;
long earthPopulation;
boolean done;
int x;
```


### Primitive Data Type

> A __primitive data type__ is ...

There are 8 primitive data-types

`double` stores _fractional_ number values.

`float` stores _fractional_ number values.

`long` stores _non-fractional_ number values.

`int` stores _non-fractional_ number values.

`short` stores _non-fractional_ number values.

`byte` stores _non-fractional_ number values.

`boolean` stores _logical_ values (true, or false)


#### Numeric Primitives

> short, int, long, float and double.

These primitive data types hold only numeric data.

Operations associated with such data types are those of simple arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc.) or of comparisons (is greater than, is equal to, etc.)


#### Textual Primitives

> byte and char.

These primitive data types hold characters (that can be Unicode alphabets or even numbers).

Operations associated with such types are those of textual manipulation (comparing two words, joining characters to make words, etc).

However, byte and char can also support arithmetic operations.
