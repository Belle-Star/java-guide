# Dragon vs Knight

## Question

A dragon and knight live on an island. This island has 7 poisoned wells, numbered 1 to 7.

If you drink from a well, you can only save yourself by drinking from a higher numbered well.

Well 7 is located at the top of a high moutain, so only the dragon can reach it.

One day, they decide that the island isn't big enough for the two of them, and they have a duel.

Each of them brings a glass of water to the duel.

They exchange the glasses, and drink. After the duel, the knight lives and the dragon dies.

__Why did the knight live?__

__Why did the dragon die?__
